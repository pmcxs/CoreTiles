# CoreTiles Server

This is a simple proof-of-concept to show a working cross-platform map tile-server written in .Net Core.
It presents a simple OpenStreetMap map with an hexagon overlay.

### Running

You'll need to install .NET Core 1.0.

After clonning this git repo the server is executed as:
```sh
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet run
```

### Next steps

Well, most likely none. This was mostly an experiment, although I might reuse some bits and pieces from this.
